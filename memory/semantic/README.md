# Semantic Memory

**Purpose**: Store stable, reusable facts about the codebase.

**What goes here**:
- Architectural patterns and designs
- Component roles and responsibilities
- API contracts and interfaces
- Design principles and conventions
- Verified technical facts

**File naming**: `<topic>-<slug>.md`
Example: `query-api-dsl.md`, `handler-pattern.md`

**Note ID format**: `sem-NNN` (e.g., `sem-001`, `sem-004`)

**When to create**:
- Discovered a new architectural pattern
- Understood how a major component works
- Found a design principle or convention
- Identified capabilities or limitations of a system

**When to update**:
- Code has changed since note creation
- User corrected a misunderstanding
- Discovered additional capabilities or edge cases

**Structure**: See `/mo/memory/DESIGN.md` for complete note template.

**Key principle**: One idea per note. Don't mix multiple unrelated concepts.

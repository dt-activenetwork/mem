# Episodic Memory

**Purpose**: Record what was done during task sessions.

**What goes here**:
- Task execution records
- Analysis session summaries
- Experiment results and outcomes
- Mistakes made and corrections applied
- Links to output files and analyzed code

**File naming**: `YYYYMMDD-t<N>-<slug>.md`
Example: `20251027-t1-java-cpg-analysis.md`

**Note ID format**: `ep-NNN` (e.g., `ep-001`, `ep-002`)

**When to create**:
- Completed a major task
- Finished a significant analysis phase
- Produced output documents

**Structure**: See `/mo/memory/DESIGN.md` for complete note template.

**Required sections**:
- Goal: What was the objective?
- Approach: How did you tackle it?
- Steps Taken: What actions were performed?
- Key Findings: What was discovered?
- Outputs Produced: Links to all created files
- Semantic Notes Created/Updated: What stable knowledge was captured?
- Next Steps: What remains to be done?

**Key principle**: Document continuously during work, not just at the end.

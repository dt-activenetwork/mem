# List main goals for the AI agent (can be updated as project evolves)
objectives:
  - objective: "Analyze and document the core architecture"
    memory_check: "Query semantic notes for 'architecture', 'design', 'patterns'"
    memory_update: "Create semantic notes for architectural discoveries"

  - objective: "Identify and document potential defects"
    memory_check: "Check episodic notes for previous defect analysis"
    memory_update: "Create semantic notes for defect patterns and fixes"

  # Add more objectives as needed

# ===========================
# PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS & SCOPE
# ===========================
# Document key facts about the project that the AI should know
assumptions:
  - "The repository uses <build tool> (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm)"
  - "The primary programming language is <language>"
  - "The main modules to focus on are: <module1>, <module2>"
  # Add project-specific assumptions

# ===========================
# DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SETTINGS
# ===========================
domain:
  # Key terminology to maintain consistency
  terms:
    - "<DomainTerm1>: Definition"
    - "<DomainTerm2>: Definition"

  # Evidence requirements for this domain
  evidence:
    - "All claims must include code quotes with file:line references"
    - "Architecture claims must cite design docs or authoritative sources"
    # Add domain-specific evidence requirements

  # External knowledge sources
  external_sources:
    - "Project wiki: <url>"
    - "API documentation: <url>"
    - "Design docs: <path>"
    # Add authoritative sources

# TASK CONFIGURATION
# ===========================
tasks:
  # Enable/disable features
  use_task_specific_indexes: true  # Build optimization indexes for large tasks
  use_incremental_work: true       # Use checkpointing for tasks >5000 lines

  # Context budgets
  max_context_per_step: 2000       # Max lines of context per incremental step
  max_task_context: 10000          # Max total context for entire task

  # Memory hygiene
  hygiene_cycle_frequency: 5       # Run memory hygiene every N tasks

# ===========================
# OUTPUT PREFERENCES
# ===========================
output:
  format: "markdown"               # Output format (currently only "markdown")
  include_diagrams: true           # Include Mermaid diagrams in outputs
  diagram_types:
    - "flowchart"                  # For processes and pipelines
    - "sequence"                   # For interactions
    - "class"                      # For architecture

  # Evidence format
  code_reference_format: "file:line"  # How to reference code (e.g., "file:line", "file:line-range")

# ===========================
# GIT INTEGRATION
# ===========================
git:
  ai_git_operations: false         # NEVER allow AI to perform git operations
                                   # Version control is user's responsibility

  # Directories to ignore in git (add to .gitignore)
  ignore_patterns:
    - "claude/temp/"               # Temporary working directory
    # - "claude/memory/semantic/"  # Uncomment to keep memory private
